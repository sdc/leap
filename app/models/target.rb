# = Target
#
# These are (hopefully) SMART targets stored against a person. They can be attached to any other event in the system, usually
# taken to be the event which inspired the target or towards which the target is working. 
#
# This model is eventable. It creates two events when set, one showing the creation of the target and one as a reminder of the target's
# completion date. When it is completed it new event noting its completion.
